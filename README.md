Welcome to the Lunatic Lander - Repo 

# Purpose 

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate redux.js and ngredux . 

There is a vanilla js implementation which can simple be run by loading
__moonprovisoric.html__ . 

However for the AngularJS version you have to check that your node and 
npm are not too old and then you have to run and install the whole thing
with

	npm install
	npm start

Okay, this will take severale megabytes on your hard disk , sd card or 
whatever but you get a server running which you can access through

http://localhost:8080 . 

In case you are new to this , check your computers IP with __ifconfig__
and then replace "localhost" with that IP on your smartphone. 

# Further

There will be a codepen version out soon, an interesting article on my
<a href="http://coding4lifeblog.wordpress.com/">blog</a> and hopefully 
a presentation with slides which I plan to contribute to my local FCC group. 

# Solution

Okay, I could not sleep at night and so added a program which calculates the 
solution. See the results by loading __autopilot.html__ in your browser. 

Have fun !
