<h1>technical background to the moon landing</h1>

Well, I think it should be worth to mention some physical or technical details to the moon landing.

The moon has no notable atmosphere , so there's no aerobraking.

The spaceship , probe or whatever has a limited amount of fuel.

It is mentioned elsewhere that half of the mass of the moon landing module was fuel.
Something around 8000 kg of fuel and the mass of the total module was 16000 kg. 

For ease I will be using an exhaust velocity of 3200 m/s.

The moon has a surface gravity of 1.62 m/ss and an escape velocity of 2380 m/s .

In order to making the "simulation" or "game" not to boring I assume a maximal
burning time of the engine of 100 seconds at full thrust.

This means that at full or 100% thrust the engine consumes 80kg per second. 
At 1% this will be a hundred times less or 0.8 kg .

At 100% this results in a delta-v of 
                        80 kg * 3200 m/s / current mass of spaceship.

Assuming a mass of 16000 kg in the beginning this would make 16 m/s . 
The mass of the spaceship is however constantly changing as the fuel is ejected.                     

The simulation starts at a height of 100 000 m over the surface of the moon. 
This means that without braking the spaceship will crash with around 569.2 m/s
in around 351 seconds. 

For safe landing a speed of less than 5 fps or 1.5 m/s is required.
